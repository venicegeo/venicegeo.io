  <p>Please pardon our dust while we remodel.</p>
  <p>The Venice Project is an open source community focused on building open source, cloud-based frameworks, tools, applications, and other initiatives in support of Geospatial Intelligence (GEOINT) needs.</p>
  <p>Piazza, one of the VeniceGeo projects, is a set of services aimed at helping developers build GeoInt applications and services. Piazza provides features like data load and access, workflow execution, and execution of user-provided services deployed elsewhere on the web&mdash;features that developers could build themselves, but often shouldnâ€™t have to. Documentation can be found at <a href="http://pz-docs.venicegeo.io">pz-docs.venicegeo.io</a>.</p>
  <p>We welcome your interest, questions, and participation! Contact us at <a href="mailto:venice@radiantblue.com">venice@radiantblue.com</a>.</p>
