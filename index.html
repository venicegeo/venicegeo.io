Please pardon our dust while we remodel.
The Venice Project is an open source community focused on building open source, cloud-based frameworks, tools, applications, and other initiatives in support of Geospatial Intelligence (GEOINT) needs.
Piazza, one of the VeniceGeo projects, is a set of services aimed at helping developers build GeoInt applications and services. Piazza provides features like data load and access, workflow execution, and execution of user-provided services deployed elsewhere on the web — features that developers could build themselves, but often shouldn’t have to. Documentation can be found at http://pz-docs.venicegeo.io.
We welcome your interest, questions, and participation! Contact us at mailto:venice@radiantblue.com.
